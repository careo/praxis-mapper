# praxis-mapper changelog

## next

* Fixed handling of loads where :staged, which could cause an incorrect underlying query using a "staged" column.

## 3.1

* Begin migration to Sequel for `Query::Sql`. 
  * `#_execute` uses it for a database-agnostic adapter for running raw SQL.
  * `#_multi_get` uses it generate a datbase-agnostic where clause
* Added accessor generation for `one_to_many` associations in resources.
* Imported `Model` extensions for FactoryGirl to `praxis-mapper/support/factory_girl`.
 * This also adds `IdentityMap#persist!` to insert all rows in the identity map into the database.
* Added `SchemaDumper` and `SchemaLoader` for dumping and loading schema information in `praxis-mapper/support/schema_dumper` and `praxis-mapper/support/schema_loader` respectively.
* `IdentityMap#all` now accepts non-identity keys as conditions, and will create a secondary index for the key the first time it's queried.
* Added `Model#identities` to get a hash of identities and values for a record.
* Auto-generated attribute accessors on `Blueprint` do not load (coerce) the value using the attribute. Ensure values passed in already have the appropriate types. Blueprint attributes will still be wrapped properly, however.
* Performance and memory use optimizations.
* `IdentityMap#load` now supports eagerly-loading associated records in a query, and supports the full set of options on the inner query, including 
* Tracked `:one_to_many` associations now support where clauses. Using `where` clauses when tracking other association types is not supported and will raise an exception.


## 3.0

* Moved Blueprint inner attribute creation to finalize!
* Added :dsl_compiler and :identity as valid options for Blueprint.
* `Praxis::Mapper::Model`
  * `Model.context` allows named query parameters to be reused across queries. See documentation for details.
  * `Model#_query` references original query that loaded the record.
  * `Model.serialized_fields` returns hash of fields defined with either `json` or `yaml` directives as serialized fields.
  * Fixed accessors will to raise `KeyError` if the record does not the field (i.e., if it was not loaded from the database), rather than silently returning `nil`.
* `Praxis::Mapper::Query`:
  * Multiple `select` and `track` calls within one query are now additive.
  * `track` option now takes a block that will be applied to the query used to load the tracked records.
  * `context` directive to apply the named context from the model to the query. See documentation for more.
* `Praxis::Mapper::IdentityMap`
  * Removed `:track` option from `#add_records` in favor of using `Model#_query` to determine tracked associations.
* Added `Praxis::Mapper::Support` with `MemoryQuery` and `MemoryRepository` for use in testing data loading without requiring a database.


### Notices

The `Model` accessor changes may break existing applications that (incorrectly) expect unloaded attributes to return `nil`.


## 2.1.0

*  Blueprint.validate now only accepts objects of the its type.

## 2.0.0

* First pass at reworking model associations.
  * Split `belongs_to` into `many_to_one` and `array_to_many` associations

  * Added association configuration DSL to replace previous hash-based configuration.


## 0.3.1
